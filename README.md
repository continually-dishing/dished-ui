# Dished UI

## About the Project

This repository is designed to hold all the documentation & source code for the UI of the application “Dished”. This README is broken up into different sections to give you an overview of how the application was built and what tools are needed. Once those prerequisites are met, follow the steps to then launch the application. Any issues/errors you run into should be documented to support better documentation for our installation steps.

## Tools
- React


## Roadmap
- [ ] Create/save inital mock images for UI design future references
- [ ] Create visually appealing/informative homepage
- [ ] Create weekly dinner menu generator
- [ ] Have UI communicate with microservices to pull data back & display back to the user
